# Using the test UI

Currently you will need to cd into the test_ui location and run `npm run dev` to get it running locally on port 5173

The code is currently hard coded to internal-dev so theres currently nothing uses the environment field on the config page
Put in the internal-dev APIKEY to enable the UI to authenticate with the CPM Apigee Proxy
